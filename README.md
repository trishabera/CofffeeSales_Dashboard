Project Title - Interactive Coffee Sales Dashboard in Excel
1.	Introduction
- This project is an Excel-based interactive dashboard designed to visualize and analyze coffee sales data for a fictional coffee retailer. 
2.	Business Problem
- The sales and marketing team lacked a centralized, intuitive view of their sales performance across countries, customer segments, and product types. As a result, decision-making was reactive and not data-driven.
3.	Goal
  
•	Build a dynamic, user-friendly dashboard to track coffee sales trends over time.
•	Provide insights into top customers, high-performing countries based on popular product attributes like roast type, size, coffee type.
•	Enable quick filtering and data slicing to support business decisions related to marketing campaigns, inventory, and customer targeting.
4.	Walking Through the Key Visuals

•	Slicers - A time-line filter to analyze sales over time, slicers for roast type, loyalty card, coffee size, and coffee type for deep-dive analysis.
•	Line Chart – Total Sales Over Time: Displays month-wise sales trends by coffee type, helping identify seasonality and performance dips.
•	Bar Chart – Sales by Country: Highlights country-wise revenue contributions, with the U.S. leading the sales.
•	Bar Chart – Top 5 Customers: Shows which customers generate the most revenue, useful for loyalty and retention strategies.
5.	Highlighting the Insights

•	The United States accounts for the highest sales revenue.
•	Arabica and Robusta types show strong performance across months.
•	Certain months show peaks in sales — valuable for seasonal promotions.
6.	Business Impact

•	Make data-backed decisions for marketing and inventory.
•	Monitor monthly performance trends and adjust strategy proactively.
